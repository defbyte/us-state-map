# US 2011 Unemployment by State

A little demo visualization which displays 2011 unemployment data, by state.

Look Ma, no jQuery!

Uses:

* [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org) - built as modules.
* [Raphael](http://raphaeljs.com) for drawing the map.
* [JSON2](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js) in the event the browser does not natively support JSON.
